### Data source
For this project, the datasets were downloaded from the [Plataforma Nacional de Datos Abiertos](https://www.datos.gob.mx/), Mexico’s National Open Data Platform. As of May 2025, this website has been modified, and an [historic data archive](https://historico.datos.gob.mx/) is now available, allowing users to search additional databases from Mexican government institutions. 

To gather relevant data, I searched for the term "petróleo", which returned over 90 results, including datasets and official documents published by P**EMEX (Petróleos Mexicanos), SENER (Secretaría de Energía), INEGI (INstituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía)** other Mexican government institutions.

For this project’s scope, I selected **15 datasets**, all related to Mexico’s petroleum, gas, and oil industry. You can access the original datasets through [this Github repository](https://github.com/alejandralopezgalan/petroleos-mexicanos/tree/main/assets/datasets/raw) and [this Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ht727_UwEuUORxWzpP4smzny2tHzYurv?usp=sharing).
